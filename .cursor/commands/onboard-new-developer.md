# Onboard New Developer

## Purpose
- Provide a guided path for new teammates joining the UnPuff codebase.
- Accelerate productivity by front-loading context, tooling, and contacts.

## Use This When
- A new engineer is joining the project.
- You are refreshing onboarding steps to reflect recent changes.

## Pre-Onboarding Checklist
- GitHub access granted (repo + required org teams).
- Project management tools (Linear/Jira/Notion) access confirmed.
- Add to Slack/Discord channels and email lists.
- Share product vision deck and design guidelines.

## Day 1: Environment Setup
1. Invite the developer to the repo and ensure SSH/HTTPS access.
2. Walk through `README.md` setup: Node version, npm install, `npm run dev`.
3. Install platform tooling:
   - Xcode + Command Line Tools for iOS.
   - Android Studio + required SDKs.
4. Introduce Cursor workflow: commands directory, review shortcuts, git integration.
5. Verify they can run `npm run check` and `npm test` without failures.

## Day 2-3: Context Download
- Architecture overview (client/server/shared directories).
- Review `design_guidelines.md` and component library usage.
- Explain state management, data fetching patterns, and API boundaries.
- Pair on a small bugfix or documentation PR to learn review flow.

## Week 1 Goals
- Ship at least one small change (docs or low-risk bug).
- Join standup/async updates and contribute status.
- Shadow deployment/release process if possible.

## Support & Follow-Up
- Assign a buddy/mentor for the first month.
- Schedule check-ins (end of week 1, week 2, month 1).
- Maintain an onboarding doc for questions, decisions, and helpful links.

## Tips
- Encourage newcomers to ask “why” behind conventions.
- Collect feedback on the onboarding process to improve future iterations.
- Keep access requests tracked so nothing slips through.
